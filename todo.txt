Initially, when the program starts, it shows the keybinds. To actually start the game rn you have to press r (reset) and then d (deal)
    I feel like it should Shows the commands at all times and intially show press d to deal. That could be something to work on. 

Game Logic: 
    * An Ace should be worth 1 or 11   
    * The hand value could be rendered somewhere
    * It seems like the dealer behaves normally, but that will require testing
    * Right now, if you are in the reset screen it will still allow you to hit and then it will render cards to the screen, shouldn't be allowed
    * Just adding, you can hit at any point in the state of the program which I am not a fan of
    -- a thought: added a flag called allowedToHit and set it to true based on the state of the program 
    * There needs to be a way to for the game to know when to shuffle the deck, also once cards are popped to render they should be added back to the deck 
Once all the things seem to work appropriately then I will add functionality for betting and doubling down, after that I think splitting makes sense.
