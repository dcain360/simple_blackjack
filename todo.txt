Initially, when the program starts, it shows the keybinds. To actually start the game rn you have to press r (reset) and then d (deal)
    I feel like it should Shows the commands at all times and intially show press d to deal. That could be something to work on. 

Game Logic: 
    * An Ace should be worth 1 or 11   
    * The hand value could be rendered somewhere
    * It seems like the dealer behaves normally, but that will require testing
    * Right now, if you are in the reset screen it will still allow you to hit and then it will render cards to the screen, shouldn't be allowed
    * Just adding, you can hit at any point in the state of the program which I am not a fan of
    -- a thought: added a flag called allowedToHit and set it to true based on the state of the program 
    * There needs to be a way to for the game to know when to shuffle the deck, also once cards are popped to render they should be added back to the deck 
Once all the things seem to work appropriately then I will add functionality for betting and doubling down, after that I think splitting makes sense.

Also, just wanted to add you can stand at anytime
There needs to be some type of system to manage the rules based on which state the program is in 
Currently allowed to do way too much at times in which you should not be able to, like you can deal at any moment or stand 


General Blackjack things that it doesn't do rn;

- if you get an ace it thinks it is an 11 not a 1 or an 11
- when player or dealer gets an Ace and a 10 card the game does not recognize this as a blackjack 
- if you get 2 identical cards you cannot split
- if player hand_value and dealer hand_value are equal there is no push, actually I don't think there is a case at all for this 

spamming keys during the stand pause timer cause unexpected behavior

Draw the Dealer's down card 

!! Just randomly encountered some weird behavior due to aces only being valued at 11. If you get 2 aces the game bugs out
it thinks you have an initial hand value of 22 which is not accounted for. 

There needs to be a way for the game to know when to shuffle, my initial idea was to add a variable that is incremented everytime the add card fucntion is called
